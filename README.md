#Validator

An object validation module that exports a "validate" class that can, based on the inputs, validate whether or not an entity is satisfactory.

Is the entity itself the right type (array, object, function etc)
All all "required" properties present and do they have values?
For any property that specifies a type, does the value match that type?
i.e. an array of only numbers
